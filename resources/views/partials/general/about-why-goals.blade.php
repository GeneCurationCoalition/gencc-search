        <h2 class="my-3">Why is the GenCC needed?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-900 leading-normal">
            Several groups and resources provide information that pertains to the validity of gene-disease relationships; however, the standards and terminologies to define the evidence base for a gene’s role in disease are still evolving, and the community is in need of trusted and harmonized sources that define the level of evidence for a gene’s role in disease. To tackle this issue, the Gene Curation Coalition (GenCC) was formed.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-900 leading-normal">
            The Gene Curation Coalition brings together groups engaged in the evaluation of gene-disease validity with a willingness to share data publicly, to develop consistent terminology for gene curation activities, and to facilitate the consistent assessment of genes that have been reported in association with disease.

            <li>Clarify the overlap between gene curation efforts</li>
            <li>Understand the aims, processes, information used, classification systems, and users of the different curation efforts</li>
            <li>Develop consistent terminology for validity assessment as well as inheritance, allelic requirement, and mechanism of disease</li>
            <li>Collaborate on gene curation projects</li>
